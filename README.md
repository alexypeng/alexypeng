## Hey there, I'm Alex Peng ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year Computer Science & Finance student at the University of Waterloo!

Currently, I am working on personal projects, like websites, games, and other random projects! I am also currently learning Python and Full Stack Web Development. I am most interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, but I am always willing and excited to learn about new things!

**See you guys around!**
